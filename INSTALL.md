# Supported OSs and architectures

The app is made to work for __windows only__, both __32-bit__ and __64-bit__ are fine.  
Personally tested both architectures in windows 7 and 10

# Manually building and installing the app

If you decide to build it yourself you will need add a folder named __KeyCounter__ in you __ProgramData__ folder,
this folder should have inside the provided __Icons__ folder and a shortcut to the app (__Key Counter.lnk__) inside.  
  

In addition to this the folder __KeyCounter__ from __ProgramData__ and all its children should have its permissions set to _Full control_ for _Everyone_  
  
Note that the __ProgramData__ folder is found in __C:/__ but is hidden by default
